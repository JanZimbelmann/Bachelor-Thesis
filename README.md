# Bachelor-Thesis

This is my bachelor thesis with the title: 'Implementation of a Method for Reconstructing Broadband Dielectric Properties'.
Besides you can find the python scripts used to produce the evaluation of the data descriped in the Thesis.
The forward.py creates a set of scattering parameters and the inverse.py reconstructs the permittivity of a set of scattering parameters.
It makes sense to read through the --help information on each of the files.
